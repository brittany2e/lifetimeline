# lifetimeline
This project is a lifetime timeline used for family history data visualization.

I created it to experiment with the Meteor framework and to have a little fun with JavaScript and css. Also, I really like to do family history, so this will be fun. :)

## To do
* Sucessfully load GEDCOM file
* Make the timeline readable/pretty.
* Maybe include people that only have one date (birth or death) - only if their birthdate is at least 110 years ago. It's possible I am missing data in my tree info.
