# lifetimeline
This project is a lifetime timeline used for family history data visualization.

I created it to experiment with the Meteor framework and to have a little fun with JavaScript and css. Also, I really like to do family history, so this will be fun. :)

## To do
* Read identifier name, birth date [, and death date] from the gedcom file for each person. Ignore family links for now.
